## Overview

You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel master! In this homework assignment you will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 
Files

[Test Data](./alphabtical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

Stock Data - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.

## Tasks

Create a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.

You will also need to display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume.

Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.

Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.
